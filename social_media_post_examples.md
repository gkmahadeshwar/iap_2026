## Mathematical Biology

### Post 1: Turing Patterns
**Topic:** Alan Turing's reaction-diffusion equations
**Post:**
In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that simple chemical reactions + diffusion could create spots, stripes, and spirals in nature. 70 years later, we're still finding his equations everywhere—from zebrafish stripes to cardiac arrhythmias. Math predicting biology at its finest.

### Post 2: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Laws
**Topic:** Kleiber's Law
**Post:**
Why does metabolic rate scale with body mass^0.75 across 20+ orders of magnitude—from bacteria to blue whales? West, Brown & Enquist showed it emerges from fractal-like vascular networks optimized for nutrient delivery. One equation. All of life.

### Post 3: Chaos in Population Dynamics
**Topic:** May's logistic map
**Post:**
Robert May showed in 1976 that a simple equation for population growth (x → rx(1-x)) can produce chaos. Lesson: deterministic ≠ predictable. Ecology, epidemiology, and even cardiac dynamics all exhibit this beautiful complexity.

## Biophysics

### Post 4: DNA as a Polymer
**Topic:** Worm-like chain model
**Post:**
DNA isn't just a genetic code—it's a semiflexible polymer with a persistence length of ~50 nm. This means physics constrains how it bends, loops, and packs into your nucleus. Information storage meets materials science.

### Post 5: Molecular Motors
**Topic:** Kinesin walking
**Post:**
Kinesin "walks" along microtubules taking 8 nm steps, converting ATP hydrolysis into directed motion with ~50% efficiency. For comparison, car engines are ~25% efficient. Evolution has been optimizing nanomachines for billions of years.

---

### Post 6: The Physics of Protein Folding
**Topic:** Levinthal's paradox
**Post:**
A 100-amino-acid protein has ~10^100 possible conformations. Sampling one per femtosecond would take longer than the age of the universe. Yet proteins fold in milliseconds. The energy landscape must be funneled, not flat. Physics > brute force.

## Biochemistry

### Post 7: Enzyme Kinetics
**Topic:** Michaelis-Menten and beyond
**Post:**
The Michaelis-Menten equation (1913) is still biochemistry's workhorse. But single-molecule experiments now show individual enzymes have "memory"—their activity fluctuates over time. The average hides the individual.

---

### Post 8: Allosteric Regulation
**Topic:** Monod-Wyman-Changeux model
**Post:**
How does hemoglobin "know" to grab O2 in lungs and release it in tissues? Cooperative binding + allosteric effects. The MWC model (1965) showed proteins are molecular switches, not just catalysts. Molecular computation before computers.

---

### Post 9: The Central Dogma... Isn't
**Topic:** Reverse transcriptase and RNA world
**Post:**
"DNA → RNA → Protein" was the central dogma. Then came reverse transcriptase (RNA → DNA), ribozymes (RNA = catalyst), and now we know ~80% of our genome is transcribed. Biology loves exceptions.

## Systems Biology

### Post 10: Network Motifs
**Topic:** Uri Alon's work on circuit design
**Post:**
Evolution repeatedly converges on the same network motifs: negative autoregulation for speed, feed-forward loops for filtering noise. Cells are running the same algorithms we'd engineer. Convergent design across 4 billion years.

---

### Post 11: Robustness and Fragility
**Topic:** Biological control systems
**Post:**
Bacterial chemotaxis achieves perfect adaptation—response returns to baseline regardless of signal strength. The cost? Specific protein ratios must be exact. Robust to some perturbations, fragile to others. No free lunch.

---

### Post 12: Stochastic Gene Expression
**Topic:** Noise in biology
**Post:**
Identical twins aren't truly identical. Same genome, same environment, different phenotypes. Why? Gene expression is stochastic—individual mRNA molecules matter. Noise isn't just tolerated; sometimes it's exploited.

---

## Structural Biology & Bioinformatics

### Post 13: AlphaFold and the Protein Structure Problem
**Topic:** AI meets biology
**Post:**
50 years of the protein folding problem, solved by deep learning in 2020. AlphaFold2 predicts structures with experimental accuracy. But knowing the structure doesn't tell you the function. The next 50 years: dynamics, interactions, design.

---

### Post 14: Sequence Space is Vast
**Topic:** Protein evolution
**Post:**
There are 20^100 possible 100-amino-acid proteins. That's more than atoms in the observable universe. Evolution has sampled a vanishingly small fraction. What functions remain undiscovered in sequence space?

---

## Evolution & Theoretical Biology

### Post 15: Fisher's Geometric Model
**Topic:** Adaptation in high dimensions
**Post:**
Fisher (1930) showed that beneficial mutations become rarer as organisms approach an optimum, and large mutations are almost always deleterious. Adaptation must proceed in small steps. Geometry constrains evolution.

---

### Post 16: Neutral Theory
**Topic:** Kimura's insight
**Post:**
Most molecular evolution is neutral—not adaptive. Kimura's neutral theory (1968) was controversial but explains why molecular clocks exist. Selection is strong, but drift is everywhere.
